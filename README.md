# Downtime to Revenue Impact Tool

## Overview
The Downtime to Revenue Impact Tool is a web-based decision-support application that helps businesses understand how system downtime translates into revenue loss and business impact. Instead of treating downtime as only a technical issue, this tool converts outages into clear financial insights to support better operational and DevOps decisions.

## Problem Statement
Many organizations experience system downtime but lack visibility into its real business impact. Downtime is often handled as a technical issue, leading to underestimation of revenue loss and delayed investments in monitoring, reliability, and infrastructure improvements.

## Solution Approach
This tool allows users to input basic business and system parameters such as:
- Number of customers per hour  
- Average order value  
- Downtime duration (in minutes)  
- Type of failure  

The system calculates revenue loss, classifies the impact level (Low, Medium, High), and displays the results in a clear and simple format. Based on the impact level, it also suggests appropriate actions to help decision-makers respond effectively.

## Key Features
- Revenue loss calculation based on downtime
- Impact classification (Low / Medium / High)
- Business-oriented suggestions for each impact level
- Clean UI with Home, Input, and Result pages
- Client-side implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Tech Stack

## Why This Project Matters
This project bridges the gap between technical failures and business outcomes.  
By expressing downtime in monetary terms, it helps founders, managers, and operations teams make informed decisions about system reliability, DevOps investments, and risk mitigation.
