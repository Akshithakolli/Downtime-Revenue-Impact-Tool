Website Logic

When a user opens the website, they are first shown the Home page, which explains the purpose of the tool and identifies who it is useful for, such as founders, managers, and operations teams.

The Home page also includes a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section to address common doubts and a call-to-action button that directs the user to the Input page.

On the Input page, the user enters:

Number of customers per hour

Average order value

Downtime duration (in minutes)

Type of failure (for example, payment failure or checkout failure)

The system then converts the downtime from minutes to hours, calculates the revenue per hour, and computes the total revenue lost during the downtime period.

Finally, the user is redirected to the Result page, which displays the estimated revenue loss and classifies the business impact as Low, Medium, or High to support better operational and business decision-making.

Impact Level Classification

After calculating the revenue loss, the system compares the value against predefined thresholds to determine the severity of the impact:

Low Impact: Revenue loss less than ₹1,00,000

Medium Impact: Revenue loss between ₹1,00,000 and ₹5,00,000

High Impact: Revenue loss greater than ₹5,00,000

This categorization helps users quickly understand how serious the downtime was from a business perspective.

Suggested Actions Based on Impact Level

To make the experience more engaging and practical, the tool displays light-hearted but helpful recommendations based on the impact level.

If the Impact is Low

The system suggests:

Monitor the system regularly

Review logs and incident frequency

No immediate major investment is required

If the Impact is Medium

The system suggests:

Improve monitoring and alerting mechanisms

Automate deployments and rollbacks

Review checkout and payment reliability

If the Impact is High

The system suggests:

Invest in stronger DevOps automation

Add redundancy for critical systems such as payments

Prioritize reducing downtime during peak business hours
